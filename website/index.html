    <h1>Sports Box Score Manager app (Group 10)</h1>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Vision</h2>
</b>

<p>
This application is a box score manager. This application will be used to keep track of scores, their performance, their points, etc. in a sport. From basketball to football, this application will have multiple sports since each sport have a different scoring system. Each sport will have it's detailed box score that keeps track of field goals, points, rebounds, etc. This application can be used to keep track of a performance of a single, or several games, or it can also be used to keep track of games throughout a whole season and multiple seasons.
</p>

<b>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Intended Users (Who is this app is for)</h2>
</b>
<p> The target users for this application are people who are involved in sports. These users partake in a sports activity in a casual manner with other players or partake in an organized sport setting or. These users would like to keep scores and track every participant’s performances in a casual pickup game or in an officaited game.

<b>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overview</h2>
</b>

<p>
This application will be used to keep track of scores in a sport. It is a way to keep information about an ongoing sporting event. It can also be used to keep information about multiple events either happening at the same time or previous sporting events that already occured, which are saved and archived on the application. The application can be used for record keeping. There are going to be multiple sports in the application, since each sport has a different scoring system from each other. There will also be a generic score box so that users can design how they want to keep scores for household games like ludo etc. This will include how many points to add, how long the sport should last, and more.
</p>

<b>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sales Pitch</h2>
</b>
<p>Unlike other bookkeeping apps, our apps will help users keep the games and scores more organised by being game specific.
The benefit of using our application over others is that with ours, it is built to specialize in what it does so there are features that make it best suited towards sports and score keeping activities such as being able to keep scores over multiple events, being able to create add and edit teams,being able to pick desired sport Since different sports have different Scoring systems. Users will also be able to start and stop the timers for sports that have the feature implemented.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">A postmortem of our development experience</h2>
</b>
    <p> We will just keep it simple and discuss what went right and wrong with our project</p>
    <li>What went right in the development process?</li>
    <p>
        Starting early and brainstorming a lot of Ideas helped us knowing what we want as a group and helped us started with a great foundarion. 
    </p>
    <br><li>What went wrong in the development process?</li>
    <p> Losing a lot of teamates, not having enough communication between us and starting the later Iterations late really cost us in terms of work done and quality of code. Moreover, in terms of features, we discussed that there are couple of features that didnot go as we planned them to in the beginning of the course
<br><li> Previous saved Games:
We planned to implement this with real time data where a user should be able to click Previous saved          game button and continue playing the saved game with saved players name and their score. But now we only have fake button that almost do nothing, but start new activity.</li>
<br><li> Players:
We planned to make an application with adjustable number of players, where users can add or subtract number of players playing in the game. However lack of space in the layout we fixed our number of players to just 2 now.</li>
<br><li> No developer tasks:
Due to structure of our app and low number of teamates, we could not develop any developer tasks in our app</li>

<br><li>Iteration 1: We decided to complete the first layout and most essential 11 features but we could only complete 7 as we were new as a team and new to the andriod studio.</li>
<br><li>Iteration 2: Few of our teamates opted out of the course so we only decided to implement 7 features at this time, we only were able to complete 5 features.</li>
<br><li>Iteration 3: More of our teamates dropped out, Its just us two left and we decide to each do 1 new feature and do system testing together. and do the website later on</li>
