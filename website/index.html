<br><li>Iteration 1: We decided to complete the first layout and most essential 11 features but we could only complete 7 as we were new as a team and new to the andriod studio.</li>
<br><li>Iteration 2: Few of our teamates opted out of the course so we only decided to implement 7 features at this time, we only were able to complete 5 features.</li>
<br><li>Iteration 3: More of our teamates dropped out, Its just us two left and we decide to each do 1 new feature and do system testing together. and do the website later on</li>
