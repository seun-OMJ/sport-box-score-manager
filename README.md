# Sport Box Score Manager

## Vision Statement

It can also be used to keep information about multiple events either happening at the same time or events that already happened and are saved on the application.

Since the application is for keeping records, some sports will be added and the application will be able to grow based on the sports the users want added. There will also be a generic score box so that users can design how they want to keep scores for household games like ludo etc. This will include how many points to add, how long the sport should last, and more.
