From basketball to football, this application will have multiple sports since each sport have a different scoring system. Each sport will have it's detailed box score that keeps track of field goals, points, rebounds, etc. This application can be used to keep track of a performance of a single, or several games, or it can also be used to keep track of games throughout a whole season and multiple seasons.

There will also be a generic score box so that users can design how they want to keep scores for household games like ludo etc. This will include how many points to add, how long the sport should last, and more.

### Value
Unlike other bookkeeping apps, our apps will help users keep the games and scores more organised by being game specific.

Users will also be able to start and stop the timers for sports that have the feature implemented.

This application will be considered successful based on the following criterias:

### Notes for Iteration 2
Our teamates Harry Pu and Patrick Isenor dropped out of the course that made our team left with only 3 team members, hence we only have few features implemented. Harry Pu was responsible for Unit Testing and Patrick was responsible for Feature drop down sports list and some HSQLDB implementation.
