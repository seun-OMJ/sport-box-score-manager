# Sport Box Score Manager

## Vision Statement
The sport box score manager will be used to keep track of scores in any of the available selected sports. The software will be made into a downloadable application for easy access. The app will be used to keep track of scores of games over a season, who can proceed in a tournament and the time played for specific sports.

### Target Demographic
The target users for this application are casual players. These users partake in a sports activity in a casual manner with other players. These users would like to keep scores and track every participant’s performances in a casual pickup game. These users would also like to track their personal performances for each sporting event they partake in.

### Project Description
The application is a way to keep information about an ongoing sporting event. It can also be used to keep information about multiple events either happening at the same time or previous sporting events that already occured, which are saved and archived on the application. This application can be used for record keeping. This application will track every game which can be used to track the game statistics for every player that participated on a sporting event. There are going to be multiple sports in the application, since each sport has a different scoring system from each other.
There will also be a generic score box so that users can design how they want to keep scores for household games like ludo etc. This will include how many points to add, how long the sport should last, and more.

### Value
Unlike other bookkeeping apps, our apps will help users keep the games and scores more organised by being game specific. 
The benefit of using our application over others is that with ours, it is built to specialize in what it does so there are features that make it best suited towards sports and score keeping activities such as being able to keep scores over multiple events, being able to create add and edit teams,being able to pick desired sport Since different sports have different Scoring systems. Users will also be able to start and stop the timers for sports that have the feature implemented.
