Discussion:
1) Discuss a part of your project that has not been as successful as you would have liked :
 We discussed that there are couple of features that didnot go as we planned them to in the beginning of the course
    a) Previous saved Games
        We planned to implement this with real time data where a user should be able to click Previous saved          game button and continue playing the saved game with saved players name and their score. But now we only have fake button that almost do nothing, but start new activity. 
    b) Players
        We planned to make an application with adjustable number of players, where users can add or subtract number of players playing in the game. However lack of space in the layout we fixed our number of players to just 2 now.
    c) No developer tasks
        Due to structure of our app and low number of teamates, we could not develop any developer tasks in our app 

2)  How it can be improved in this iteration. Determine concrete (and realistic) ways of improvement, and decide how its success will be evaluated at the end of the iteration (measurable and objective):

Due to reduction in the number of team members and less amount of work hours now, We have decided to a) keep only one save game in the app; b) Reduce the number of players to just 2 and fix the layout and c) not add any developers task into the app.

3) Also include a chart (as an image) showing the 2 data points of project velocity from the last two iterations:

Iteration 1: We decided to complete the first layout and most essential 11 features but we could only complete 7 as we were new as a team and new to the andriod studio.

Iteration 2: Few of our teamates opted out of the course so we only decided to implement 7 features at this time, we only were able to complete 5 features.

Iteration 3: More of our teamates dropped out, Its just us two left and we decide to each do 1 new feature and do system testing together. and do the website later on
