Discussion:
1) Discuss a part of your project that has not been as successful as you would have liked :
 We discussed that there are couple of features that didnot go as we planned them to in the beginning of the course
    a) Previous saved Games
        We planned to implement this with real time data where a user should be able to click Previous saved          game button and continue playing the saved game with saved players name and their score. But now we only have fake button that almost do nothing, but start new activity. 
    b) Players
        We planned to make an application with adjustable number of players, where users can add or subtract number of players playing in the game. However lack of space in the layout we fixed our number of players to just 2 now.
    c) No developer tasks
        Due to structure of our app and low number of teamates, we could not develop any developer tasks in our app 

2)  How it can be improved in this iteration. Determine concrete (and realistic) ways of improvement, and decide how its success will be evaluated at the end of the iteration (measurable and objective):
